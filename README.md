# HTML Bootstrap boilerplate
### How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run hot`

It will automatically start a server at `http://localhost:8080/` using `dist/` as the public path

### Development
The source files you will be working with are `assets/js/app.js` and `assets/css/app.scss`. Laravel mix will automatically compile it to `dist/js/app.js` and `dist/css/app.css` respectively.
